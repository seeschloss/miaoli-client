# Miaoli Client

This is a React Native tribune client.    
It has only been tested on Android for now.

## Installing

I am assuming your are already an Android developer. Otherwise there are a bunch of things to install first and I won't go into it now.

Connect your Android phone (or emulator?) to your computer, then:

    npm install
    react-native run-android
    
This will install and run the app on your phone.
